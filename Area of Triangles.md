Right Triangles
Any rectangle cut diagonally produces two equal right triangles. Thus, area of a right triangle is:
$$
Area=\frac{1}{2}ab
$$
Obtuse triangle (one angle is greater than $90 \degree$)

Acute triangle (all angles are less than $90 \degree$)


Parallelograms
*Any* paralellogram can be diagonally cut into two equal triangles. Thus, the area of a paralellogram is twice a triangle:
$$
Area=a\times b
$$
