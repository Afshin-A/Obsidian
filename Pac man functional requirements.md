you have 4 cops (different colors), move independently
you have 1 pacman that is player controlled
you need to maneuver the environment and eat all the coins
each coin ups your score
display score on top
have the option to pause the game
if you collide with a cop, position of player and all cops resets and you lose one life
display remaining lives at the bottom of the screen
randomly generated super coins temporarily freezes the cops

what if we make the maps randomly generated? 
we need a data structure to store/represent the map (2D array?)
