In the context of software testing, refer to [[Software Testing Principles and Strategies#Static Testing]]

Otherwise, __static__ refers to changes or operations performed __before runtime__ during compile time.
__Dynamic__ refers to changes or operations performed __at run time__. 

Inheritance, for example, is static because the class structures are set at compile time, before runtime. But using design patterns like [[Strategy]] or [[Decorator]], we could add functionality to classes during run time. This is a dynamic change.
