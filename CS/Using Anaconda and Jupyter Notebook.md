When we create a virtual environment, we can keep all the dependencies and configuration (the state) of our project encapsulated (separated). 

The `ipykernel` package can be used to convert an anaconda virtual environment to a kernel that can be used in jupyter notebook. 

Jupyter notebook has many shortcomings, so instead I'd rather take advantage of the `ipynb` format within Visual Studio Code, which is a code editor with many great features such as documentation, auto complete, etc..
