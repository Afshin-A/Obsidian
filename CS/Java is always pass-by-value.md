In java, an object is stored as a reference in the stack, where the actual object is stored in the heap.
Java methods take in values. For literal values (like int, float, boolean) the values happen to equal the literal values. But for objects, the values are their heap addresses.

In conclusion, literal values are pass by value. But objects are pass by reference.
