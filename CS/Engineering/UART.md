One of the earliest protocols for transmitting data, typically between a micro controller and a peripheral device on a board

Is asynchronous, meaning the transmitter and receiver do not share a common clock

Buad rate (bits per second) is the rate of transferring data. Before data can be transferred, the transmitter and receiver must communicate about a baud rate
