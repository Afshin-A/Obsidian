we use both white-box and black-box techniques

unit testing that involves boundary analysis and equivalence partitioning


black-box testing: does not apply this project because I'm working solo, not in a team. this is when testers test the program without knowing the internal structure of the program or the code, as an end user would.

integration testing: does it apply to this project?
