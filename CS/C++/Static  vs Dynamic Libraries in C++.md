Static libraries
---
 Static libraries are dependencies that are included in the executable/compiled binaries. Everything is compiled together. They're part of your program. This way, the program is shipped with all its dependencies. Your program will also run faster. But the downside is that file size will go up. 
Dynamic libraries
---
 Dynamic libraries are standalone. These are the `.dll` files that are shared across the system. They're referenced during runtime.
