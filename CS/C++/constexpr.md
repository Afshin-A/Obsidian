`constexpr` enables computation during compile time. It applies to both functions and variables. It's usually used to enhance performance by moving simple, unnecessary computations from runtime to compile time. Because a `constexpr` function is evaluated at compile time, they have many restrictions. For example, run-time operations like polymorphism ( the `virtual` keyword) do not work because this feature selects the right type of object during runtime. In addition, `constexpr` functions can only include literal values. A literal value is one that is part of the language construct, like numbers, booleans, and `nullptr`. Even though objects are typically created at runtime, `constexpr` funcions can include custom objects. However, the object and its members will need to be modified for compile time: for example, methods, inlcuding the constructor, must be declared as `constexpr`. All fields must also follow that pattern.
