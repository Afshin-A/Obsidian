## Raw Strings
In python, the prefix `r` to a string, such as `r'He\l\lo world!'` treats characters literally as they are. In other words, the backslash `\` isn't treated as an escaping character. This is useful for regex because `\` plays an important role in expressions, and we wouldn't have to escape the `\` itself.
