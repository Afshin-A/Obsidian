A library is a set of pre-written code, such as functions and classes that provide a functionality. They're reusable, and provide a solution to your problems. Instead of writing your own code. No need to re-invent the wheel. 

Frameworks are a collection of libraries. It's a full on solution to your problem. The backbone of your application. It's a rigid structure that controls the eb and flow of your application. It automatically takes care of many common tasks for you in the background, without you even having to do anything. Example is Angular, or Express, which runs on top of Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment. Express is a framework that can initialize your app.
