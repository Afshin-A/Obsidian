Suppose we want to find $x^8$.
We could multiply $x$ 8 times by itself. This is manageable, but it gets considerably more difficult to do as the exponent increases. 
$$
\begin{align}
x \cdot x = x^2 \\
x^2 \cdot x^2 = x^4 \\
x^4 \cdot x^4=x^8
\end{align}
$$
We've reduced 8 multiplications to only 3

Finding $x^{15}$ can also be simplified in the following manner:
$$
\begin{align}
1111 \\
x
\end{align}
