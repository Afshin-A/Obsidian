Conduct an interview at the start of design process.
Getting to know the users.
Gather opinion about existing products
What features should we include?
Gather insight about the target users
Explore a topic in detail

**Have a clear, specific goal for the interview and plan questions**
How concerned is the user about shopping for healthy food
Picture yourself shopping groceries. How would the user go on about picking healthy food at a grocery store.
How would the user feel about using an app? Would the user trust the provided analytics and recommendation? How would an app be important to you?
What features would the user like to see form such an app?

**Selecting interviewees**

open with an introduction
ask open, non-leading, non-suggesting questions
	Talk to me about your approach to buying healthy food.
	How do you feel about using an app to give you advice about the food you buy?
	What features would you like to see in such an app?


I am conducting research as part of my project to design an app that will help users make healthy decisions in their food. Using the app, you can scan an item and see how it rates health-wise. Do you have any questions? 



	How do you feel about using an app to give you advice about the food you buy?
	What features would you like to see in such an app?


the purpose of this paper is to conduct research, gather and analyze results to define a target audience and their needs, and consequently develop user personas.

The objective of the interview is to learn about the users so that the design of the app is directed towards their needs. More specifically, (list the agenda, but with less details)

Describe interview settings. All interviewees have given permission to record the interview.
pre-scheduled interviews, over the phone or face to face, Zoom sessions over the internet.

Agenda with an overal structure:
How often do you shop for groceries? Where do you shop for groceries? Why there?
What is your attitude towards shopping for healthy food/groceries?
Picture yourself shopping groceries. Talk to me about your approach to buying ~~healthy~~ food.
How would you go on about picking one product over another? What difficulties would you face?
How would you feel about using an app? 
How would such an app be important?
What features would the user like to see form such an app?



Features:
The app should also track and consider the users daily activity and other factors such as age, gender, etc. to measure their needed calories input when making recommendations.
To do so, it must be compatible with fitness devices, such as activity trackers and sport watches.
Allow users to create foot charts where they can keep track of their input.
The app should also keep track of the users need for minerals and vitamins.
While not entirely related, users also showed interest for recommendations in health and beauty products, ruling out those with hazardous ingredients.
users may prefer a particular grocery store for several reasons, such as travel distance and prices, so the app should make recommendation based on these settings.

unbiased. should be complete. build trust between usersr.



======================

A user persona is a fictional character that represents a group of users.
it contains our learnings from conducted research, including user characteristics, needs, and goals. 
This is important because in order to solve a problem, we first must understand the problem. who are our primary users and what are their problems? how 
it helps connect with the users and make design decisions with them in mind

Are most people actively looking for healthy options? 
What percentage of the interviewees align with that? what percentage of the population aligns with that?
use this information to build your personas. make them feel real.
