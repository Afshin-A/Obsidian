### What is HTTP?
A client (i.e. a browser) contacts a server through the internet using an address. The **Universal Resource Locator** (**URL**), also referred to as **Universal Resource Identifier** (**URI**), contains a protocol that defines how contact is made between client and server, just like an [[Application Programming Interface|API]] defines how users can access a service. A common protocol is **HTTP**, or **HyperText Transfer Protocol**. The server then processes the request, and *transfers* the information, along with HyperText language (HTML) back to the client. The browser uses the html to display the page to the user.
The protocol also includes a verb or request method. An example is **GET**: this means the request will not make any changes and only information is returned to the client. Another example is **POST**, which means the user is sending information to be saved on the server. POST is commonly used when filling forums online.

HTTP request and response include additional information in the form of headers. These are key and value pairs that could, for example: 
- Specify in what language the server response will be. A client isn't always a browser; it could be a program written in C++. So the server will have to send its response (along with headers) in a format that our program can interpret: JSON. All programming languages have native or extended support for JSON via libraries. 
- Additionally, in our request to the server, we could specify to receive information back only if there've been recent changes (this would eliminate unnecessary processes by server and enable local caching). 
- The server's response header could inform the client if the request was successful ([200 OK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200)) or if the request failed ([400 Bad Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400))

HTTP is a [[Networking#Stateful Vs. Stateless Architecture|stateless]] protocol: ~~the server doesn't remember the state (data/fields) of a client once a request-response cycle is complete.~~ Each HTTP request is independent of the previous requests. They don't share data and are not aware of each other. Instead, the client will have to send its sate to the server with every request. For example, a user can remain logged-in a website by sending in log-in details with every request. This is usually done with the server sending a token that's stored on a browser's cookie, which is retrieved sent with the HTTP requests.
