This is a protocol just like HTTP in the application layer of the TCP/IP model. It establishes a consistent, two way connection between a client and a server, so it's a stateful protocol, unlike HTTP. 

Just like HTTP, web sockets use TCP to ensure data is securely and orderly transported throughout the internet. 


The difference between HTTP and TCP is that they do entirely different things, operating at different layers of the TCP/IP model. TCP is responsible for quantizing data into packets and sending them across the internet to the destination. 
HTTP uses TCP. HTTP defines requests and responses that applications can make and send.
