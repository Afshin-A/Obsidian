	Create a simplified interface (as in API, not a java Interface) that performs many other actions behind the scenes

This pattern is too simple to code.
Consider the following scenario: a client wishes to withdraw from a bank.
The banking application is likely consisted of many modules that function in the background, like authenticating the user, checking the requested amount is available, etc. We could create a method inside the "Facade" class that executes all those functions, just like pressing a button.
