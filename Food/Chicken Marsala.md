### Notes for Next Time
Use a pot over a pan to well mix the sauce and fettuccine later.
Use more garlic and cook for longer, but don't burn them.
The fettuccine pack contains more than it shows. Follow the amounts in the recipe.
I cooked the fettuccine until soft for much longer than 5 mins as specified on the packet.
