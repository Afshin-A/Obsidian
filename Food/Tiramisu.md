# Ingredients
Mascarpone/cream cheese (16 ounces, the whole package)
2 spoons of marsalla wine
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon of vanilla
1/3 cup sugar (3 table spoons)
coco powder
1 cup of coffee (espresso)
Lady fingers
Heavy cream
Coffee Liquor

# Cooking
Prepare the coffee and allow it to cool. Add coffee liquor.
Whip the cheese (at room temperature) for 30 seconds

Simmer some water (not boil. wait until there are tiny bubbles). Then place a bowl on top of the pot. Add egg yolks, sugar, and the wine. Continue whisking for 10-15 minutes until the mixture thickens, but you don't want the eggs to cook.
Whip the heavy cream with added vanilla
First allow the egg mixture to somewhat cool. Then add the cheese eggs, and gently mix.
Add the whipping cream next.

Dip the lady fingers into the coffee and place them in the dish. One layer of lady fingers, and one layer of cream mixture. 
Dust coco powder on top of the cream, and build another later.

# First-Time Results
Mascarpone cheese tastes somewhat sweet and bland. It doesn't really have a distinct taste, and its consistency is similair to the philadelphia cream cheese. **I should substitude mascarpone for cream cheese.**
I used instant coffee and couldn't really taste it in the lady fingers. **I should use espresso next time.**
I feel like the cream was too soft and could use a smaller percentage of whipping cream. **So use less whipping cream.**
