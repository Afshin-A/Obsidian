2 chopped bell peppers
Cherry peppers (but I'm using green peppers). Sauce should be spicy.
8 chopped garlic cloves
Chicken breasts
Rigatoni pasta
Crushed tomatoes (I'm using fresh tomatoes)
1 cup of white wine
1 cup of cream (I think this is too much, so use less.)
Parmesan cheese

Wash the chicken. Cut into bite sized pieces. Season with salt and pepper, then white flour. Heat (medium) the pot for a few minutes, then sear chicken in olive oil and a hint of butter.
Use a pot or a large pan so you can mix the pasta and sauce more easily later on.
Start boiling water for pasta.

Remove chicken.
Add bell peppers. Cook until soft (7 mins)
Add garlic and cook until golden. Add more oil if needed.
Add cherry peppers.
After 1 min, add wine. TURN AWAY FROM PAN!
Cook for about 3 mins until liquid reduces.
Add tomatoes. Lower heat.
Let sauce simmer.
After a few more minutes, add cream.
Add the chicken.
If sauce is too thick, add pasta water.
Add the pasta to sauce and mix.
Add parsley.
Serve with parmesan.
