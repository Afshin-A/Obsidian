All purpose flour has a lower protein percentage than bread flour, so less gluten will be formed, and the resulting baked goods will be short and dense.
Bread flower would yield more gluten. Baked goods will be taller and more airy/fluffy.

The more water you use in dough, the more it will rise.
50% --> dense
75% --> good
100% --> dough will be like batter

For every 100mL of water, we add 145g of flour. Therefore, the following recipe yields 3 (10 inch) pizzas. 
# Poolish
- 300mL warm water
- 300g flour (I used all purpose flour)
- 5g honey (I added 1 table spoon)
- 5g (instant) yeast

Do not add salt in this step because it would slow down fermentation.

Mix ingredients: water, yeast, and honey, followed by the four in increments. Refrigerate for 16-24 hours.
# Dough ~70%
==The total amount of water is approximately 70% of the total amount of flour in the dough.==
Transfer the poolish to a larger bowl and add an additional 135g of flour in increments. Transfer the dough to a board.
Knead will take place in two parts. First, we do most of kneading (like 80%) using the slam and fold technique until gluten forms. The dough should be sticky by this point. We then cover the dough and leave it for 15 minutes. This should reduce the stickiness. We then knead for a bit longer (the remaining 20% of progress).
Cover the dough in a blanket for 30 mins to 1 hour.
Divide the dough in 3 equal parts and make into balls. Cover for an additional 30 mins.

Turn on the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit and place the iron pan inside.
