## Ingredients
- 2 bell peppers, diced.
- Cherry peppers (but I'm using green peppers). Sauce should be spicy.
- Lots of garlic, minced 
- Chicken breasts, bite-sized
- Rigatoni pasta, 1 lb
- Crushed tomatoes (I'm using fresh, grated tomatoes w/ tomato paste)
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 cup cream (I think this is too much; use less.)
- Oregano leaves
- Basil leaves
- Parmesan cheese

## Recipe
- Season chicken with salt & black pepper, then white flour. Heat (medium) the pan for ~3 mins, then sear chicken in olive oil & butter. (Use a pot or a large pan so you can mix the pasta and sauce more easily later on.)
- Start boiling water for pasta. Add 2 tbsp salt.
- Remove chicken from pan.
- Add bell peppers. Cook until soft (~7 mins).
- Add garlic and cook until golden. Add more oil if needed.
- Add green peppers.
- After ~1 min, add wine. **WARNING! TURN AWAY FROM PAN!**
- Cook for ~3 mins until liquid reduces.
- Add tomatoes. Lower heat & allow simmer. 
- Add oregano.
- Add cream.
- Add the chicken back. If sauce is too thick, add pasta water.
- Add Basil.
- Add salt & black pepper if needed.
- Add the pasta to sauce and mix.
- Serve w/ parmesan.

## Notes
Replace chicken with Italian sausage?
