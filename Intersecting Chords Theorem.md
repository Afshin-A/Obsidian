This theorem is true for any two chords that intersect each other within any circles.

Suppose two chords in a circle intersect at a point such that one chord is divided into legnths of $a$ and $b$ and the other chord into lenghts of $c$ and $d$. Then,
$$
ab = cd
$$
# Proof
The proof uses the inscribed angle theorem to show that the intersecting chords create two similar triangles.
