$a \ sin\Big(b(x-c)\Big)$ is just the graph of $a \ sin(bx)$ shifted 

Periodic functions are used to model many natural phenomena, such as the 
harmonic motion of a mass attached to a vertical spring, variation in air pressure to create sound, variation of star brightness, number of daytime hours in a day throughout the 

$S_n=1+S_0S_1S_2\dots S_m \dots S_{n-1}$
$S_n=1+XS_m, \ X=S_0S_1S_2\dots \hat{S}_m \dots S_{n-1}$
The hat symbol means we're excluding $S_m$
