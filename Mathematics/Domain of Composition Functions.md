Suppose two functions f(x) and g(x) are defined. f(g(x)) can be described as follows:
g(x) takes in values that consist its domain. f(x) will then take the outputs of g(x)

f(x)=x^2
g(x)=(2-x)^(1/2)

f(g(x))=f((2-x)^(1/2))=((2-x)^(1/2))=x-2

The graphs of f(g(x)) and y=x-2 are not the same because they have different domains.
`f(x)=x^2`
