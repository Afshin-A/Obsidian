Consider an arbitrary point $A$ on the graph of an arbitrary function $y=f(x)$.  $A(b,a) \text{ and } C(a,b)$. Using the mid-point formula, we can show that $B$ is on the line $y=x$ and that $\overline{AB}=\overline{BC}$

The inverse of a function can be itself. An example is $f(x)={1 \over x}$ because $f^{-1}(x)={1\over x}$  
$f(x)=y={1\over x} \implies x={1\over y}\implies f^{-1}(x)={1\over x}$
Such graphs are symmetric with respect to the line $y=x$
