Suppose we have 
$$\begin{align}
S=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{a_k}
\end{align}
$$
If $\lim_{k \to \infty}{a_k}\neq 0$, then $S$ diverges. The intuition is that as we approach infinity, the terms of the sum aren't getting smaller, so they keep adding on and on, and the sum diverges to infinity.

However, the opposite is not guaranteed. In other words, if $\lim_{k \to \infty}{a_k}= 0$, it doesn't necessarily mean that $S$ will diverge. A counter example is the following:
$$\begin{align}
S=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{k}}
\end{align}
$$
This sum in fact diverges.
