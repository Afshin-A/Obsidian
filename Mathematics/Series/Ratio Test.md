This test is loosely based on the geometric series

If we have a series with a common ratio, if the absolute value of the ratio approaches a value greater than 1, the sum converges. If it reaches a value smaller than 1, the sum diverges. If it reaches 1, the test is inconclusive

Suppose we have a sum such as the following:
$$\begin{align}
S=\sum_{n=k}^{\infty}{b_n=(-1)^n \ a\ r^n} 
\\
\\
\lim_{n\to \infty} \lvert \frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} \rvert = L
\end{align}
$$
If $L>1$, $S$ diverges
If $L<1$, $S$ converges
$L=1$, test is inconclusive
