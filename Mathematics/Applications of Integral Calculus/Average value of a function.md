$$
h=\frac{\int_a^b{f(x)\ dx}}{(b-a)}
$$
The average value of of a function $f(x)$ would be the sum of all y values divided by the number of values. As we integrate $f(x)$, we're adding up areas of bars under the graph. Each bar as an infinitesimal base, but the height is the value of $f(x)$. So the integral is basically the sum of all the values. 

Another way to think about it is this: the average value represents all the values. So, when we multiply this value by the the interval $(b-a)$, it should yield the same area as the integral:
$$\begin{align}
h(b-a)=\int_a^b{f(x)\ dx} \\
h=\frac{1}{(b-a)}\int_a^b{f(x)\ dx}
\end{align}
$$
