Assuming $f$ is a continuous function, there exists at least one point $c \in (a, \ b)$ such that 
$$
f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
$$
# Mean Value Theorem for Integrals
$$
f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}=\frac{\int_a^b{f'(x)dx}}{b-a}
$$
Let $g(x)=f'(x)$
$$
g(c)=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b{g(x)dx}
$$
There exists a point $c$ in $(a, \ b)$ such that $f'(c)$ equals the average of all derivatives in that range.
