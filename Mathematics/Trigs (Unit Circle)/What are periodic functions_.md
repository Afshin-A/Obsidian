A function $f(x)$ is periodic if there exits a number (or numbers) such that $f(x+t)=f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain.

The graphs of $sin(x)$ and $cos(x)$ are straight derived from the unit circe. So we mainly focus on horizontal and vertical shifts, shrink, and stretching.
$y=a+sin(x)$ is the same as $sin(x)$ shifted up by $a$ units.
Compared to $y=sin(x)$, $y=a\ sin(x)$ is stretched vertically (elongated along the y-axis): $-1 \leq sin(x) \leq 1 \implies -a \leq a \ sin(x) \leq a$
$y=sin(kx)$ 

#### How to tell if a function is periodic?
From its graph




Period of $y=tan(x)$ is $\pi$ so the interval $[0, \pi]$ is one period just as $[-{\pi \over 2}, {\pi \over 2}]$ is one period. However, we pick the latter because the graph is continous over that interval. There is a vertical asymptote at $x={\pi \over 2}$ because we have ${sin({\pi \over 2}) \over cos({\pi \over 2})}={1 \over 0}$
