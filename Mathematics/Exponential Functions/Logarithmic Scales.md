In order to dwindlea graphical scale (figure 1) and make it more managable, we can transform it into a logarithmic scale (figure 2)

Figure 1

We basically take $log_{10}$ of all numbers in Figure 1 to get Figure 2:

Figure 2

In Figure 2, 1 is actually $10^1$, 2 is $10^2$, 3 is $10^3$, and so on. Going from one number to the next represents an increases of 10 times in magnitude.

##### The pH scale
$\text{pH}=-log([H^+])$
The negative sign flips scale horizontally. If we were studying $log([H^+])$, high concentrations (acidic) would be far into the right, and low concentrations (basic) would be on the left and beyond 0. The $-$ flips these numbers around: high concentration is to the left, and low concentration is to the right.

##### The Richter scale
$M=log({I \over S})$ 
$I$ is the magnitude of the earth quake of interest, measured by a device known as the seismometer. The seismometer measures and records the seismic waves of an earthquake in a seismograph. This is an integral part of the seismology field.
$S$ is the magnitude of the standard earth quake.
If, for example, $M$ of an earth quake is measured to be 9 richter, that means:
$$log({I \over S})=9 \ \to {I \over S}=10^9$$
This means $I$ is 1 billion times stronger than $S$
